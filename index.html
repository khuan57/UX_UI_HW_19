                <h3>Hey! I'm Kristi, a UX/UI designer based in Atlanta, Georgia.</h3>
                <p>I recently completed my certification in UX/UI design at Georgia Tech, just after graduated from Emory University with a Bachelors in Business Administration.</p>
                <p>Currently I am a marketing coordinator in Atlanta and have worked hands-on with projects that are focused on solving user problems.</p>
                <p>I started my passion for UX/UI design with the creation of my baking blog, BaoBeiBaked. Combining my hobby of baking with the creativity and management needed for website and content curation has allowed me to tackle challenges eagerly and develop critical skills.</p>
                <p>I love to try new foods at new cities in the world as I try to travel across the globe as much as I can.</p>

                    <h4>Clarify Mobile App</h4>
                    <p>Alongside 2 other UX/UI designers we researched, ideated, brainstormed and prototyped a mindfulness app.</p>
                    <p>There were multiple iterations and each team member was able to bring something unique that allowed us to create a well-thought out and beautiful interface.</p>

                    <h4>USDA.gov Website Redesign</h4>
                    <p>Working collaboratively and individually, I redesigned the USDA website for desktop and mobile as an assignment.</p>
                    <p>Creating a RWD for an already existing website had its challenges, but I learned a lot during each stage of the project.</p>
